# Midterm-PIT
Short Demo:





The project is about generating the Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals which is the simulation of the sounds being produced just by pressing keys on a phone keypad. Each of the sound has a certain signal. 

What is used?:

Flask: For serving the web-based interface.
JavaScript: To handle button inputs and communicate with the server.
Sounddevice: For generating the DTMF tones based on the selected keys.
UI: This is built by using Python Flask, a framework using JavaScript for the interactive web interface such as the selection of phone keypad keys.
Sound Generation: The system used sounddevice library for real time generation of the audio given by DTMF frequencies for each key.
Graph: Visualize the generated signals using Plotly, with adjustable time-domain and frequency-domain graphs.
Keypad Sound: Each keypress produces the corresponding DTMF tones, giving an authentic phone keypad experience.


Libraries:
Plotly: To create dynamic and adjustable graphs for signal visualization.
